# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Fork versioning.** This is the `Pitz72/Timebox` fork. Fork builds use SemVer
> build-metadata versions of the form `<upstream-base>+fork.<n>` (e.g.
> `0.6.0+fork.1`) so they stay distinct from upstream `valeriogalano/Timebox`
> releases while preserving SemVer precedence. Fork entries are dated and follow
> the same Keep a Changelog sections used upstream.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0+fork.1] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- Cross-platform update notifier (`lib/update-notifier.js`): on macOS, where `electron-updater` (Squirrel.Mac) cannot install unsigned/ad-hoc builds without an Apple Developer ID, the app now checks the latest GitHub release, compares versions, and prompts the user to open the download page instead of failing silently. Wired in `main.js` only on `darwin`.

### Changed
- On Windows (NSIS) and Linux (AppImage), where `electron-updater` works without code signing, updates are no longer downloaded silently: `autoDownload` is now `false` and the app asks for confirmation before downloading (`Scarica` / `Più tardi`) and again before restarting to install (`Riavvia e installa` / `Più tardi`). See `lib/updater.js`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- Rebuilt the macOS release packaging so the app bundle receives a complete ad-hoc code signature during `electron-builder` packaging.
- Disabled macOS signing identity auto-discovery for GitHub builds, preventing partial or invalid local-development signatures from being applied to release bundles.

### Documentation
- Documented the personal macOS installation flow for non-notarized builds, including removing Gatekeeper quarantine with `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Timebox.app`.

### Changed
- Removed older GitHub Releases (`v0.4.0`, `v0.5.0`, and `v0.5.1`) so the only downloadable release is the verified `v0.5.2` build. The Git tags remain available for source history and comparisons.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Superseded by `0.5.2`; its GitHub Release assets were removed because the macOS package could still be rejected by Gatekeeper as damaged.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- MCP tool to summarize the daily plan (`feat: add MCP daily summary tool`)
- MCP tool to surface imported Todoist tasks for today (`feat: add MCP tool for imported Todoist tasks`)
- MCP tool to detect daily plan/actual mismatches (`feat: add MCP daily mismatch tool`)
- MCP tool to report free capacity for the day (`feat: add MCP free capacity tool`)
- MCP tool to list ready blocks for the day (`feat(mcp): add ready blocks daily tool`)
- Cross-platform app path handling, generalized for OSes beyond macOS (`feat: generalize cross-platform app paths`)

### Fixed
- Timesheet totals now align with the visible planning data (`fix: align timesheet totals with visible planning`)
- Past recurring weeks are now frozen instead of being recalculated (`fix: freeze past recurring weeks`)

### Documentation
- Documented the MCP daily planning tools
- Clarified CI and release triggers across project documentation
- Aligned and cleaned up project documentation, removed external project reference, added agent project instructions

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-15
